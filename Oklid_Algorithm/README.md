# Oklid Algorithm

This java program implements oklid algorithm to find greatest common divisor of 2 given non-negative integer.

## Algorithm Steps

0. For any non-negative real number `p` and `q`, the algorithm aims to find the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
1. If q = 0 return p and end.
2. Initialize r and set 'remainder of p / q' to it.
3. Set q to p then set r to q and return step 1.

## Usage

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Download oklid.java or clone repository

2. Set p and q at 4. line of code

3. Compile java code:

```
javac oklid.java
```

4. Run the program:

```
java oklid
```
